This project aims to explore the effects of sample techniques and side information on factorization machines using MovieLens dataset.

We compared the Factorization Machines with different side information (movie genre and genome scores) with the basic Matrix Factorization model with no side information and evaluated their performances using metrics including RMSE, AUC, and coverages. In addtion, we explored the effects of sparsity and sample size for these models and measured the differences in  accuracy when the dataset is sampled from sparsely-populated to well-populated, and from small sample to large sample.
